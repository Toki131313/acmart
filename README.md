acmart
======

This package provides support for scribble to target the
[2017 ACM Master Article Template](http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template),
LaTeX class `acmart.cls` v1.28
(actually downloading a recent enough version
[from github](https://github.com/borisveytsman/acmart)).

Its current state is very preliminary --- not fully working
(notably, no effort was spent on the HTML backend), and
with no promise that its current interface is stable.

A lot of inspiration was taken from Vincent St-Amour's `acmsmall` package,
itself inspired from Asumu Takikawa's and Vincent St-Amour's `lipics` package.

For an example article that uses this package, see
