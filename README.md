scribble/acmart-fare
====================

This is my (Francois-Rene Rideau, aka Far√©) package for scribble to target the
[2017 ACM Master Article Template](http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template),
LaTeX class `acmart.cls` v1.48
(actually downloading a recent enough version
[from github](https://github.com/borisveytsman/acmart)).

I wrote written before the scribble/acmart language currently part of the Racket distribution,
with the help of Leif Andersen. I renamed it from scribble/acmart to scribble/acmart-fare after
the latter language became the official support.
It is available for backward compatibility with documents written before the official
scribble/acmart package was written, and/or after it was broken.
We encourage users to use the official package, after fixing it if necessary.

Its current state is still incomplete: it supports the LaTeX/PDF backend well,
but no effort was spent on the HTML backend. It will probably never be completed,
since efforts are likely better expended on the official package instead.
The two packages are not compatible in the details of their API,
even though they both wrap the same LaTeX class (e.g. this has the Lispy name acm-conference
where the official package has the LaTeX-y name acmConference).

A lot of inspiration for this package was taken from Vincent St-Amour's `acmsmall` package,
itself inspired from Asumu Takikawa's and Vincent St-Amour's `lipics` package.
